The Schema is built, I know can can force min and max values if I make it's data type numbers, I need to add some Regex /^[0-9]*10$/ so only numbers are returned, or I can save them as strings, and make a .length check between 10-13, still learning how to do validation. I have gotten Mocha installed on another local project, and once I get further along on this one, will add it to allow for TDD.

I found that no one seems to use Number type for phoneNumbers, and once that was learned, I wrote some RegEx to find the 3 phoneNumber
formats I was given.  Then added some name Length Validation, 2 char's seemes relevent with Jo or Ng as possible real names we might store.
Lastly, the email Regex was hard, and did some research and found http://emailregex.com/
and used the javaScrpt pattern found there.
